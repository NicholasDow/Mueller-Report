# Mueller-Report

This project is meant to showcase and test methods for going through dense text. I specifically looked at Mueller report here, and you can explore what I found here: https://nicholasdow.shinyapps.io/Report/. In future deployments I hope to expand upon the Webscraping, and figure out how to more specifically direct that web crawling and scraping to find crucial information. 

If you have too much reading to do feel free to use some of this code to more effectively tackle your work.
